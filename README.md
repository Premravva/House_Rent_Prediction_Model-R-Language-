# Hosue Rent Prediction Model using R

## Overview
This project aims to predict real estate prices using a machine learning model based on a variety of features such as the number of bedrooms and the availability of amenities. The model helps potential buyers estimate the cost of a house without
needing a broker, streamlining the decision-making process for customers.

## Abstract
Real estate is a critical asset, especially in cities that serve as job hubs, attracting a large number of individuals. This project leverages a "Linear Regression** model" to estimate the market value of properties. The prediction model takes into
account important factors like the number of bedrooms and the presence of amenities, providing customers with a practical solution to find homes that meet their needs. The model offers an alternative to consulting with brokers, making the buying 
process more efficient.

## Objective
The main objective is to assist potential buyers by providing an estimated market price for real estate properties. The automated model can help buyers determine if a property is overvalued or undervalued, making the decision process more 
transparent and unbiased.

## Approach
We have implemented a "Linear Regression" model for predicting house prices. The project also explores various data preprocessing techniques, such as feature engineering and handling missing data, to improve model accuracy. 

## Data
The dataset used for this project includes key features such as:
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Property size (in square feet)
- Availability of amenities (e.g., parking, swimming pool, gym)
- Location data
- Historical pricing

## Model and Techniques
- Linear Regression**: Chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in predicting continuous variables like house prices.
- Feature Engineering**: To handle missing data and optimize feature sets for better prediction accuracy.
  
## Results
The Linear Regression model was able to predict house prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The model could be further improved by experimenting with more advanced regression techniques and increasing the dataset's size and quality.

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic framework for predicting real estate prices based on historical and feature-based data. It serves as a useful tool for potential first-time buyers or less experienced customers who want to make informed purchasing 
decisions without involving a broker.

## Future Work
- Incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Enhancing data quality by including more features like neighborhood ratings, property age, and recent economic trends
- Creating a user-friendly interface to make the model more accessible to non-technical users
